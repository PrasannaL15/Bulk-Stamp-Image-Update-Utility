# Bulk Stamp Image Update Utility

## Overview

This Python script serves as a comprehensive Bulk Stamp Image Update Utility, designed to streamline the process of updating stamp images for a given set of data. The script utilizes various libraries and modules to achieve its functionality.

## Features

1. **Web Scraping Setup**: The script sets up a custom User-Agent for web scraping using the `urllib.request` module to simulate a web browser and avoid detection.

    ```python
    opener = urllib.request.build_opener()
    opener.addheaders = [('User-Agent', 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/36.0.1941.0 Safari/537.36')]
    urllib.request.install_opener(opener)
    ```

2. **File Retrieval Function**: The `getFile` function is designed to retrieve files from a given URL based on publisher and product names. It returns a tuple indicating success and the file content.

    ```python
    def getFile(url, publisher_name, product_name):
        return (False, 'junk')
    ```

3. **Excel Handling**: The script imports the `pandas` library for efficient handling of Excel files. The `readexcel` function writes the data from a DataFrame (`df_out`) to an Excel file named "output.xlsx."

    ```python
    def readexcel():
        df_out.to_excel("output.xlsx", index=False)
    readexcel()
    ```

4. **Data Processing**: Leverage the power of the `pandas` library to process and manipulate data efficiently, ensuring that the stamp image update is seamlessly integrated with the existing dataset.

5. **Warning Handling**: The script incorporates a warning module to capture and handle any potential issues during execution.

    ```python
    import warnings
    warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")
    ```

6. **Modularity**: The script is structured in a modular fashion, making it easy to extend and adapt for specific use cases. Additional functions can be added to enhance the utility further.

7. **Output Customization**: Tailor the output Excel file name and format based on your preferences and organizational needs.

## Input Data Format

To effectively utilize the Bulk Stamp Image Update Utility, ensure that your input data is structured in a specific format within the Excel file. Follow the guidelines below to prepare your input data:

### Excel Sheet Structure

1. **Column Names**:
   - The Excel sheet should have column names representing essential information such as:
     - **Publisher Name**
     - **Product Name**
     - *(Additional columns specific to your dataset)*

     Example:
     ```markdown
     | Publisher Name | Product Name | Additional Column 1 | Additional Column 2 |
     |-----------------|--------------|----------------------|----------------------|
     | Publisher_1     | Product_1    | Value_1              | Value_2              |
     | Publisher_2     | Product_2    | Value_3              | Value_4              |
     ```

2. **Data Values**:
   - Populate the rows with the corresponding data for each column.
   - Ensure that the data is accurate and matches the criteria for stamp image updates.

### Example

For a more concrete understanding, consider the following example:

```markdown
| Publisher Name | Product Name | Image URL                                  | Release Date |
|-----------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Publisher_1     | Product_1    | https://example.com/stamp_images/image_1.jpg | 2022-01-01   |
| Publisher_2     | Product_2    | https://example.com/stamp_images/image_2.jpg | 2022-02-15   |
